# cydcv

A c version of [ydcv](https://github.com/felixonmars/ydcv)

It is original from [cower](https://github.com/falconindy/cower)
and the linked list implementation is from
[libalpm](https://projects.archlinux.org/pacman.git),
I just modify the data structure to get it work with Youdao online
translate API.

Depends:
* [libcurl](https://github.com/bagder/curl)
* [yajl](https://github.com/lloyd/yajl)
